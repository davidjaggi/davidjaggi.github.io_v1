I am a research associate at the ZHAW SML. Prior to joining ZHAW, I worked as a Data Scientist in the Trade and Behavioral Analytics team at Credit Suisse. I hold an MSc in Investment and Finance from Queen Mary University of London and a BSc in Engineering and Management from ZHAW. My research focuses on artificial intelligence and machine learning in the field of finance. I am very interested in the financial markets and currently learning the rules of systematic trading. On this page, I would like to post some helpful stuff not only form me but also for you. The content will include some Python, R and some more general stuff which is of interest.

On my personal website, I would like to share things which I am passionate about.
